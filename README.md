Analyzing call logs &amp; ergodicity problem in economics

Problem statement 1: Analyze incoming and outgoing call patterns of a crime suspect.

Problem statement 2: Starting with an initial wealth of 100$, you engage into a simple coin-flipping game in which your wealth increases by 50% every time you flip heads and you lose 40% if you flip tails. Since tossing heads or tails is just as likely, it makes sense to accept such a game if you play enough times because your potential gain is larger than your potential loss each time you play. Yet, as we will see this is a paradox. Prove the paradox.

SOLUTION FOR BOTH THE PROBLEMS CAN BE SEEN IN THE NOTEBOOK.
